As part of my work I mostly use Go, Python, Bash, Kubernetes, and GitLab CI. Most of my professional work is not open-source. One thing I made open source is https://github.com/DataDog/aggregated-dependency-score but as of May 2025 it is inactive.

In my hobby projects (in my GitLab profile, see above) I mostly use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used to work with React, but now I use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) whennever I can.

My main hobby project at the moment is https://sempolda.fr, whose source code is at https://gitlab.com/cedricvanrompay/sempolda.
